## To-Do List For Future Development

### High Priority

- Support for "find best common time" use case (this requires the ability to reserve multiple timeslots of an meeting)
- Walk-through for website usage
- User experience testing
- Ability to view other users in registered slots (meeting must not be set to anonymous)
- Textbox for submitting text information at registration
- Ability to specify an alternate name (such a group name) for a reservation
- Reset and undo feature for meeting editing
- Editing the meeting capacity

### Low Priority

- Time conflict checks (for meeting registration. Maybe for meeting creation)
- Feedback for while waiting on a running task in the UI (e.g. the loading spinner before confirmation to show that the action is being worked on)
- Ability to export schedule (reservations) to different calendar application (google calendar)
- Reminder feature for Reservations (e.g through email)
